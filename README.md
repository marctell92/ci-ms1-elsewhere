## User Experience (UX)

Research

ElseWhere's new concept doesn't have any direct competition on the web. It's concept is dense,
therefore the goal will be to introduce this new concept to the generic public by condensing the
information in a visible and descriptive way, to help users to get familiar with the concept in the first visit.
In the future, this website could develop in a B2B (Business-to-Business) concept. However, at first we will take a B2C (Business-to-Customer) approach,
focusing on the emotional triggers such as branding and the ease of readability.

Business Goals

Present the website on a user-friendly form, where information can be absorbed easily.
Help the user understand our concept within the first visit to the website.
Connect with potential customers for future business.
Connect with potential collaborators to expand the concept and services.
